## INTRODUCTION

In this module, you will get an overview of machine learning in PySpark using the MLlib package. Then, you will learn how to implement classification tasks and build your own classification model, working with a tumor dataset.

Important point about MLlib:
MLlib supports two interfaces for implementing machine learning.

- RDD API - this is the original interface, which is still supported but not under active development
- DataFrame API - this is the newer interface, which is being actively developed
 
## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Apply the basics of the MLlib library in PySpark

- Implement classification models in MLlib

- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset
