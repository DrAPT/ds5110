### Notes for Students and Instructors
---

The most challenging topics for students have been 1) parsing text with RDDs and 2) understanding parallel computing concepts

These practices will help:

- realize that if you find these hard, it's expected. Conversely, the other topics might be easier!
- devote adequate time to review notes, practice, and complete the HW
- skim the HW early so you can begin thinking about it
- work with classmates, the TA and the instructor

Most of the course focus is:
- Using Spark for batch processing, stream processing, ML and analytics
- Cloud computing tools - learning concepts and using tools

Students enjoy the group project

Reminder that each student writes their own code in lab assignments
