## INTRODUCTION

In this module, we begin with model selection and tuning in the ML library. We review two advanced Spark objects: accumulators and broadcast variables. Finally, in the programming assignment, you will get to build some useful data science tools for the supervised learning task.

 

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Tune Spark MLlib models
- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset.
