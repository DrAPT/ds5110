### Deliverables This Week

- Quiz: 
  - SVD is MORE numerically stable compared to PCA
  - CrossValidator
    which inputs should be passed?
  -Compare CrossValidator vs TrainValidationSplit

- Programming Assignment: Building Supervised Learning Tools

---

- Review Jupyter Notebook: Dimension Reduction
  - Dim reduction particularly important w big data (want to reduce compute time, storage)

  - Walk thru PCA, SVD examples


- Review Jupyter Notebook: ML Model Selection and Tuning
  - CrossValidator
    for k-fold cross validation
  - TrainValidationSplit
    only one split

- Kickoff programming assignment: Building Supervised Learning Tools

- Continue training and evaluating models for this week; nothing to submit
