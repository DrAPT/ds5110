Notes:    
* Instructional partition is less crowded as it's dedicated for this class  
Dev partition is free for  < 1 hour  
Start with small number of cores and increase as needed  
Number of hours: when time is up, compute will end. JupyterLab notebooks save contents regularly. Request what you need.
