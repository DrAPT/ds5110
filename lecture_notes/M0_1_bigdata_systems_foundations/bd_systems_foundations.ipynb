    "### Introducing System Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we briefly describe components that will come up throughout the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "*server* - hardware or software providing a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the *client*.\n",
    "oftentimes, it is a beefy machine. examples: database server, web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "*client* - a **user program** that connects to a server to access a service. an example is a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*database* - **organized collection of data**, typically stored electronically in a computer system. can be divided into relational and non-relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*data warehouse* - central data repository for storing **structured data**. this is generally a collection of relational databases across an org.\n",
    "\n",
    "*data lake* - central data repository for **storing data of any structure**. the benefit is that unstructured and semi-structured data can be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "*load balancer* - device to distribute a set of tasks over a set of resources (generally servers), to enable scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "*front end* - layer of a system that focuses on **visual aspects**, like the web site. typically UX people work on this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "*back end* - part of the system focused on structure, business logic and data. for example, the database resides in this part. \n",

    "A **batch job** is a job run on a finite amount of data. This might consist of computing analytics or making a set of predictions.\n",

    "A **streaming job** runs on data that doesn't end. An example is processing data from a Twitter feed.\n",

    "The tiles represent components specific to Amazon Web Services (AWS), so let's unpack them:\n",
    "\n",
